This is a repository containing a breast cancer dataset and 3 notebooks. 
The first notebook pre processes the data and creates the classification dataset for mortality status as well as the regression dataset for the survival months.
The second notebook creates 3 models. A logistic regression model, KNN model and Naive Bayes model.
The third notebook creates the decision trees for the survival months prediction and an ensemble model combining the logistic regression and Naive Bayes models.
